# Latitude-Project
In order to run this app you need to download them first . 

After downloading files hit command npm install .
this will install all the necessary dependencies for you

do same with the other file as well . 

Now if you want to test the API'S use http://localhost:5000/user

If you want to post or save a user in database then use (new) after user in the url with post method.e.g(http://localhost:5000/user/new).

In order to get the data of users you need to use all after user in the url wih get method.e.g(http://localhost:5000/user/all)


and if you want to check the user weather its in the database or not just use (http://localhost:5000/user/login).with post method . 


ThankYou
